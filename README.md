# Hannah Lee's Portfolio

![Hannah Lee's Portfolio Webpage](./assets/images/portfolio-deployed-website.png)

## Description 
Every new coder stepping into the field needs to show off their abilities, and what better way than to deploy a portfolio designed by their very own hands? 

The portfolio consists of three major sections: About Me, My Work, and a Contact Me navigation bar. With a brief glance you can learn a little bit about me, and view my past coding work with the click of the mouse. A navigation bar has been included at the top to access any part of the page!

Have I peaked your interest? Take a look! If you think I'm the candidate for you, please feel free to reach out to me by phone number or email!
